## Hi! I'm Ilham Fazri 👋

I'm an AI Engineer from Indonesia 🇮🇩, who likes to build some projects with DeepLearning/Machine Learning frameworks, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, and backend APIs. Also, I have a little bit of experience in building a native android app using Java.

Currently, I'm working as AI Engineer at [Widya Wicara](https://widyawicara.com) and a final year undergraduate student at Gadjah Mada University. 

In my free time, I like playing games 🎮, watching movies or TV series 🍿, and reading SOTA paper in machine learning as my sleeping pills 💊.
